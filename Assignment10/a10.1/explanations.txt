Explanation for part a which states:
"Comment out the using namespace std; and then 
take your time, read and interpret the error message"

When namespace std; is commented out the compiler produces
an error stating that there is no declaration of string,cout and endl.

Since string,cout and endl can only work when declared inside a namespace
block, we need to add std:: at the beginning of each string,cout and endl
found in Critter.cpp

For this case it was added in Void Critter:: print(){
    std::cout << "I am " << name << ". My hunger level is "
    << hunger << "." <<std::endl;
}

Explanation for part b which states: "Remove the Critter:: prefix in one of the
methods in Critter.cpp, read and interpret the message"

The error produced stated that there was no definition of the name in the scope.
In this case, name belongs to the private data of the the Critter class.

In the implementation of a method for a class one does not need to use
selection operator to call methods of similar class.

Hence, we can't access the class other methods belong to since we have
not specified the class our method is in.

As a result, we have to write the definition of the method in the header file (Critter.h)
or add Critter:: to the beginning of the method definition.
